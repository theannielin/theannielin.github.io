            <p>The Harvard College First Gen Student Union is concerned with 
            the welfare and community representation of first generation students 
            at Harvard College. For the purposes of the organization, a first generation 
            undergraduate student shall be defined as one whose parents or 
            guardians have not completed a course of study at an accredited 
            four-year undergraduate institution, or an equivalent and recognized 
            qualification abroad.</p>
            <p>HC-FSGU has three main objectives: (1) To facilitate the 
            transition to college for first generation students through 
            initiatives such as providing mentorship networks and sharing 
            academic and social resources among members; (2) To build a community 
            among first generation Harvard students; and (3) To provide the first 
            generation student community a platform to express its voice and to 
            advocate for themselves.</p>
            <p>Additionally, HC-FGSU will seek to build more 
            opportunities of learning for non-first generation college students, 
            in the belief that it is important for the broader Harvard community 
            to understand the first generation student experience. 
            By communicating with non-first generation students, 
            HC-FGSU will strive to dispel any stigma or stereotype 
            associated with the first generation identity.</p>
